# Mergr üçí

Mergr is an interactive, command line interface application designed to simplify Git merge conflict resolution. It provides a visual interface for navigating through conflicting files and offers several options for handling conflicts: accepting the current version, incoming changes, or both.

Mergr integrates conflict detection, resolution, and staged merging into a unified and easy-to-use experience. This changes the developer experience for beginners who often struggle with understanding merge conflicts.
