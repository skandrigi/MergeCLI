"Q: Given this code with a merge conflict:
class User:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
<<<<<<< HEAD
        self.last_login = None
=======
        self.last_login = datetime.now()
>>>>>>> feature/tracking
What would each version do?

A:
HEAD version: This version initializes a User object with a name and sets last_login to None, indicating no login time is tracked initially.

INCOMING version: This version initializes a User object with a name and immediately sets last_login to the current timestamp when the user is created.

BOTH versions: This would combine both versions, and the current time would override and become last_login.

"Q: Given this code with a merge conflict:
function processPayment(amount) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    console.log("Processing payment...");
    return api.processPayment(amount);
=======
    console.log("Processing payment...");
    logTransaction(amount);
    return api.processPayment(amount);
>>>>>>> feature/logging
}
What would each version do?

A:
HEAD version: This version will log a message and process the payment through the API, with no transaction logging.

INCOMING version: This version will log a message, record the transaction in the system logs, and then process the payment through the API.

BOTH versions: These versions would result in duplicate console.log messages, followed by transaction logging and payment processing, which could cause confusion in the logs.

"Q: Given this code with a merge conflict:
.button {
<<<<<<< HEAD
    background-color: #007bff;
    color: white;
=======
    background-color: var(--primary-color);
    color: var(--text-color);
>>>>>>> feature/theming
}
What would each version do?

A:
HEAD version: This version styles the button with a fixed blue background color (#007bff) and white text, making it non-customizable.

INCOMING version: This version styles the button using CSS variables for both background and text colors, allowing for dynamic theme changes.

BOTH versions: These versions would cause a logical CSS error as they define the same properties twice, with the latter declarations overriding the former ones.

"Q: Given this code with a merge conflict:
<div class="user-profile">
<<<<<<< HEAD
    <img src="avatar.jpg" alt="User Avatar">
    <h2>{{username}}</h2>
=======
    <img src="avatar.jpg" alt="User Avatar" class="rounded-circle">
    <h2>{{username}}</h2>
    <span class="badge">{{role}}</span>
>>>>>>> feature/roles
</div>
What would each version do?

A:
HEAD version: This version displays a basic user profile with a square avatar image and the username.

INCOMING version: This version displays an enhanced user profile with a circular avatar image, the username, and a badge showing the user's role.

BOTH versions: These versions would create two of the same images and headings, which may not be expected structure by having duplicate img and h2 elements, likely a logic error.
